dt-key-forwarder is a client/server tool for forwarding multimedia keys to different X11 display.

In order to use it, run server in the X11 session where you want to forward keys to,
and run a client in the X11 session where you want to forward keys from.

Server usage: dt-key-forwarder-server --socket /path/to/socket --lock /path/to/lock
Client usage: dt-key-forwarder-client --server /path/to/socket

Server socket is world writable, and there is no authentication mechanism,
so it's up to user to ensure that only allowed users can access server socket
using permissions on directory socket is in or any other approach

Currently only following keys are allowed to be forwarded:
	XF86XK_AudioPlay
	XF86XK_AudioStop
	XF86XK_AudioPause
	XF86XK_AudioNext
	XF86XK_AudioPrev
	XF86XK_AudioRaiseVolume
	XF86XK_AudioLowerVolume
	XF86XK_AudioMute

Interaction with rebinding of those keysyms on client or server isn't tested
